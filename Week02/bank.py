# ask the user to input two amounts in cent.
amount_1 = input("Enter amount 1 (in cent): ")
amount_2 = input("Enter amount 2 (in cent): ") 

# Add amount1 and amount2, converting them to integers from strings (I was getting this error before that: 
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int'). 
answer = int(amount_1) + int(amount_2)

# Divide the answer by 100 to convert it from cent to euro and round to 2 decimal places.
