# Project Title: pands-weekly-tasks

## Author: Orla Woods

## *Description:*
This repository contains submissions for each of the Weekly Tasks (Week 1 to Week 8, inclusive) for the Program and Scripting Module of the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics, delivered by Andrew Beatty, from January to April 2025. Final submission date for the weekly tasks GitHub repository is 28 April 2025.

## *Weekly Tasks:*  
The Weekly tasks are assigned by Andrew Beatty following each week's lecture series and labs. The file name(s) and description of the program for each of the tasks is listed as follows:

*Week 1: helloworld.py*  
This program prints Hello World!

*Week 2: bank.py*  
This program asks the user to input two amounts in cent and outputs the sum in euro amount (including the decimal place).

*Week 3: accounts.py*  
This program asked the user to input a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with the first 6 digits replaced by Xs and the last 4 showing.
Extra: The program is modified to deal with account numbers of any length.

*Week 4: collatz.py*  
This program asks the user to input a value and outputs successive values of the following sum: "take the current value, and if it is even, divide by 2 but if it is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1". The program ends if the current value is 1.

*Week 5: weekday.py*  
This program outputs whether or not today is a weekday. There is no user input.

*Week 6: squareroot.py*  
This program asks the user to input a positive floating-point number and outputs an approximation of its square root. 

*Week 7: es.py*   
This program reads in a text file and outputs the numbers of e's it contains. The associated text file name is moby-dick.txt. To run this program in the terminal, type: $ python es.py moby-dick.txt

*Week 8: plottask.py*  
This program displays a histogram of a normal distribution of 1000 values with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2. Also, the function h(x)=x**3 in the rage 0 to 10 is plotted. Both plots are on a single set of axes. The image of the plot is saved as the file plottask.png.

## *Requirements:*  
The followong are required for the code files to run:  
- python  
- datetime module  
- sys module  
- os module  
- numpy  
- matplotlib

## *Acknowledgements:*
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Andrew Beatty for a very informative and interesting series of lectures and labs in this module, which has let me hit the ground running thanks to a very steep learning curve. It has been so interesting and I really look forward to the next modules in the course programme! (Can't believe I'm actually coding!!!! :D)
