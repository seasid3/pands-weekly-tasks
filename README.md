## Description:

This repository contains submissions for each of the Weekly Tasks (Week 1 to Week 8, inclusive). Please note that any references to sources are noted in the code as comments. They are also listed below. 

### *Weekly Tasks:*  

*Week 1: helloworld.py*  
This program prints Hello World!

*Week 2: bank.py*  
This program asks the user to input two amounts in cent and outputs the sum in euro amount (including the decimal place).

*Week 3: accounts.py*  
This program asked the user to input a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with the first 6 digits replaced by Xs and the last 4 showing.
Extra: Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length.

*Week 4: collatz.py*  
This program asks the user to input a value and outputs successive values of the following sum: "take the current value, and if it is even, divide by 2 but if it is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1". The program ends if the current value is 1.

*Week 5: weekday.py*  
This program outputs whether or not today is a weekday. There is no user input.

*Week 6: squareroot.py*  
This program asks the user to input a positive floating-point number and outputs an approximation of its square root. 

*Week 7: es.py*   
This program reads in a text file and outputs the numbers of e's it contains. The associated text file name is moby-dick.txt. To run this program in the terminal, type: $ python es.py moby-dick.txt

*Week 8: plottask.py*  
This program displays a histogram of a normal distribution of 1000 values with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2. Also, the function h(x)=x**3 in the rage 0 to 10 is plotted. Both plots are on a single set of axes. The image of the plot is saved as the file plottask.png.
